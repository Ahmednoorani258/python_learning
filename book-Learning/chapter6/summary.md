### Summary


Testing is a critical skill when writing software using Copilot.
Closed-box and open-box testing are different approaches to ensuring
the code is correct. In closed-box testing, we come up with test cases
based on what we know about the problem; in open-box testing, we
additionally examine the code itself.
Doctest is a module that comes with Python that helps us test our code.
To use doctest, we add test cases to the docstring description of a
function.
Creating artificial files is an effective way to test code that uses files.
