### Summary

We need to divide a big programming problem into
smaller subproblems before we can effectively
implement it. This is known as problem
decomposition.
Top-down design is a systematic technique for
breaking a problem down into small subtask functions.
In top-down design, we seek small functions that solve
well-defined tasks and that can be used by one or
more other functions.
When weâ€™re ready to implement our functions that
arose from top-down design, we implement them from
the bottom up; that is, we implement the leaf
functions first, then functions that depend on those
leaf functions, and so on until we implement the
topmost function.
