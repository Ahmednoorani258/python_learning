### Summary


Debugging is an important skill that includes finding
errors in code and then correcting them.
Print statements can be an effective way of learning
about what is happening in your code.
The VS Code debugger is another way of learning
what is happening in your code that provides powerful
features for monitoring how variables change as the
code executes.
Once an error is uncovered, there are multiple ways to
help Copilot fix the error for you, but if that fails, you
can often fix the code directly.
Our workflow of designing functions now includes
debugging, and with the skill of debugging, youâ€™re
more apt to write the software you want.
Outside of debugging, the VS Code debugger can be a
powerful tool in learning more about how the code
works.
